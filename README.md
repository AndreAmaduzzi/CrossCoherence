## Dataset GPT2Shape
Train-val-test splits of the proposed dataset GPT2Shape can be found in folder gpt2shape:
* [train](gpt2shape/train.csv)
* [val](gpt2shape/val.csv)
* [test](gpt2shape/test.csv)

Each CSV file contains the ShapeNet model_id of every shape, the corresponding textual description, the name and id of the category and other metadata.

## Evaluation metric CrossCoherence
